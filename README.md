# This is our Verilog Project, it is a Punch-Out boxing game that uses laser emitters and receivers to detect movement. A boxer moves on the screen to 3 different locations. If the player breaks the laser beam at the same location as the boxer, the player gains a point. If the player misses, then the boxer on the screen receives a point. In the end the scores are compared and the player is declared a winner if their score is greater than the boxer's. The complete and finished project is in the file FinalProject.v . The other files where steps or different algorithms we wanted to implement along the way.
